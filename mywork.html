                <p>I ended up working in the backend. I figured out how to store the orders in a database through a lot of trial and error. I could not get the order to add up but as long as they got it, they could do it with a calculator. </p>

                    <h4>The Affinity Diagram</h4>
                    <div class="art-content">
                <p>This tool allows you to gather large amounts of data and organizes them into groupings based on their relationship.</p>
                <p>Materials needed: sticky notes or cards, marking pens, large work surface (wall, table, or floor).</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Record each idea with a marking pen on a separate sticky note or card. (During a brainstorming session, write directly onto sticky notes or cards if you suspect you will be following the brainstorm with an affinity diagram.) Randomly spread notes on a large work surface so all notes are visible to everyone. The entire team gathers around the notes and participates in the next steps.</li>
                    <li>It is very important that no one talks during this step. Look for ideas that seem to be related in some way. Place them side by side. Repeat until all notes are grouped. It’s okay to have “loners” that don’t seem to fit a group. It’s all right to move a note someone else has already moved. If a note seems to belong in two groups, make a second note.</li>
                    <li>You can talk now. Participants can discuss the shape of the chart, any surprising patterns, and especially reasons for moving controversial notes. A few more changes may be made. When ideas are grouped, select a heading for each group. Look for a note in each grouping that captures the meaning of the group. Place it at the top of the group. If there is no such note, write one. Often it is useful to write or highlight this note in a different color.</li>
                    <li>Combine groups into “supergroups” if appropriate.</li>

                <p>I drew out my plan for the site then implemented it to the best of my ability. I can’t say it is exactly what I want but for my knowledge at that time, I think I nailed it. During this sites creation I learned that I absolutely love to design and code.</p>

                <p>This was definitely a test of my skills. There were a lot more pages than what I was used to but I did it. I finished the site. Looking back, I can’t say I exactly like the color choice. It is almost too childish, but I think the design is pretty good.</p>
                <p>I worked hard on this site and so did Shelbie. I hope to make her a real blog one day so she can post her recipes.</p>

                <h4>Capstone Project</h4>
                <div class="art-content">
                <p>The final assignment for IT Minor class was to redesign and develop a website for a real company. On the first day we were assigned out teams and given the company. The organization assigned to my group was United Way of Central Arkansas. They requested a smoother site, with updated information, a better way to store and organize information, easier access for agencies and donors, and to trim down the amount of pages on their current site.</p>
                <p>Our goal was set. My team, Abigail, Jonathan, and Jay, took that information and then we started going over their old site. It was a bit overwhelming at first. They had so much content. We decided to use the affinity diagram as our way of figuring out what to keep and get rid of. This helped us to combine pages that were similar and get rid of pages that just weren’t needed.</p>
                <p>Once we had trimmed the pages, we started looking for themes. We decided on Outreach Pro. There were some difficulties in trying to get the theme to work so we used Elementor instead. Elementor allows you to create blocks and then copy and paste them onto every page. That is what I did.</p>
                <p>I created style blocks and used those to keep a consistent theme. I realized ¾ way through this project, that I should have put a CSS Class on it and used the universal CSS Stylesheet. At that time though, it was easier to keep going with the design. </p>
                <p>These are my takeaways from this project; assign pages to your team members; communicate the color theme so all pages look the same; and never say no to working with new technology just because you don’t know it, aka United Way of Central Arkansas website’s platform. I have learned a lot from this experience and I know it will stay with me throughout my career as a Web Designer and Developer.</p>

                  <h4>Rhetorical Analysis</h4>
                    <div class="art-content">
                  <p>On December 7th, 1941, Pearl Harbor was attacked by the Japanese.  The day after the attack, Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered the Infamy Speech.  His objective was to inform the citizens of the United States that he would not stand by and allow the Japanese to attack American soil without repercussions. His use of logos and pathos convinced the populace that they needed to defend themselves against Japan.</p>
                  <p>Pathos is an appeal to emotions. Considering that the day before many people had died, the citizens of the United States were very sad and upset. He used the people’s overwhelming emotions to help him convince the Congress that war was a necessary evil. </p>
                  <p>Franklin Roosevelt also used logos. He stated the facts about Pearl Harbor, reaffirming what the people of the United States had heard, and then he finished his speech with a conclusive statement, “With confidence in our armed forces, with the unbounding determination of our people, we will gain the inevitable triumph -- so help us God.” (Roosevelt, 1941) It worked incredibly well.  Immediately afterward, Congress declared war, and the United States entered World War II. That is how convincing his speech was. </p>
                  <p>Using truth, emotions, and a conclusive statement made Franklin D. Roosevelt’s request almost impossible to say no to. His goal was to persuade the people of the United States to go to war, and he did. </p>
