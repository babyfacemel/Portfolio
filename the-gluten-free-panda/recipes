Oreo Truffle Balls

15.5 ounces GF Oreo cookies (I generally use Glutino brand  chocolate vanilla creme cookies.)
1 (8 ounce) package of cream cheese
1 package white or milk chocolate melting wafers

1  Place cookies into a food processor: process until finely crushed. Set aside about 1/4 cup of the crumbs for later. (A rolling pin and a heavy duty ziplock bag will also work in a pinch if you don't have a food processor. Just place the cookies in the bag and smash them with the rolling pin until you are satisfied with the consistency of the crumbs.)
2. Add the cream cheese, cubed; and process until well blended.
3. Roll into 1 in. balls.
4. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
5. Meanwhile place the melting chocolate in a microwave safe bowl and  zap at 45 second intervals until the chocolate is fully melted. 
6. Dip the top third of the truffles into the chocolate before sprinkling with the cookie crumbs. 
7. Store in the refrigerator. 

The recipe makes about 4 dozen truffles.
